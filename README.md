## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Instructions

1.  **Enter a Prompt:** In the chat input field on the left, type a topic for your presentation (e.g., "A pitch deck for a new sustainable coffee brand").

## üìù Assumptions & Design Decisions

### 1. PPT Stability (Image Removal)

* **Decision:** All image generation and display logic has been **removed** from the final `slideMapper.ts` and `PptPreview.tsx`.
* **Reasoning:** This was necessary due to frequent 404/CORS errors from AI-generated image URLs during testing, ensuring the core functionality (PPT download) is **100% stable** and reliable.

### 2. Model Choice

* The API is configured to use the high-quality **`gemini-2.5-pro`** model in `route.ts` to handle complex content structuring and dynamic editing accurately.

### 3. UI Library

* All UI elements are created using **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling, achieving a modern, aesthetic appearance.
